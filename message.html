    <h1>Nutrition:</h1>
    <p>
      Nutrition refers to the process of obtaining and consuming nutrients from
      food. It involves the study of the essential components of food, such as
      carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water, and how they
      impact our overall health. Proper nutrition is vital for providing energy,
      supporting growth and development, maintaining a strong immune system, and
      preventing chronic diseases.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Principles of Nutrition:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Balanced Diet:</strong> A balanced diet includes a variety of
        foods from different food groups, such as fruits, vegetables, whole
        grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. It ensures that you receive an
        adequate intake of essential nutrients.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Portion Control:</strong> Portion control is about managing the
        quantity of food you consume. It helps maintain a healthy weight and
        prevents overeating, which can lead to weight gain and related health
        issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Macronutrients and Micronutrients:</strong> Macronutrients
        include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, which provide energy to the
        body. Micronutrients consist of vitamins and minerals, which are
        essential for various bodily functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hydration:</strong> Staying hydrated is essential for optimal
        bodily functions. Water helps regulate body temperature, transport
        nutrients, and flush out waste products.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Meal Planning:</h1>
    <p>
      Meal planning involves organizing and preparing meals in advance,
      considering nutritional requirements, personal preferences, and lifestyle

        <strong>Time and Money Saving:</strong> Meal planning can save time and
        money by reducing impulsive food purchases and minimizing food waste. It

        <strong>Dietary Goal Achievement:</strong> Whether your goal is weight
        loss, muscle gain, or specific dietary requirements, meal planning
